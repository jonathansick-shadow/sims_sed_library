The galaxySED folder contains models for galaxy bulges and disks.  SEDs in the
galaxySED folder come from the Bruzual and Charlot models with Chabrier (2003)
IMF and are calculated based upon 4 different star formation histories:

- Burst: an extended period of time during which star formation occurs and then
stops afterwards.

- Constant: Star formation at a constant rate throughout the galaxy's lifetime

- Exp: Exponentially declining star formation with an e-folding time of 1Gyr

- Instant: One single, instantaneous burst of star formation

With each of these star formation histories the ages of the galaxies come in 40
different age steps between 1.585 Myr and 12.5 Gyr.  Furthermore ate each age
tehy are available at 6 different metallicities which use the Padova 1994
isochrones from Z=0.0001 - 0.05 where solar Z is set at Z = 0.02.
